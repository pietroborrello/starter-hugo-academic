summary: CPU introspection through micro-architectural data sampling.
abstract: "While the x86 instruction set architecture strictly defines the observable behaviour of modern CPU, its inner workings remain highly undocumented. The micro-operations that govern the processor are hidden behind a wall. 
Let's break this wall using vulnerabilities of the CPU itself to build a sniffer that precisely observes the micro-architectural activity.
Have you ever wanted to see what a Spectre attack looks like from *inside* the CPU? Come and see. We don't like walls!
This talk is based on the recent work of Brandon Falk."
