summary: Exploiting the Linux Kernel for Privilege Escalation.
abstract: "The exploitation of vulnerabilities in the Linux Kernel allows unprivileged users to gain root access and compromise an entire operating system.
Kernel maintainers have developed and integrated a plethora of mitigations to make exploitation harder. Examples are KASLR, KPTI, SMEP, SMAP, FG-KASLR, or structure layout randomization.
However, despite the presence of state-of-the-art mitigations, it is still possible to leverage powerful vulnerabilities or chain multiple ones to compromise the security of a system.
During this talk, we focus on how to exploit vulnerabilities in the Linux Kernel and bypass the existing mitigations to escalate privileges from untrusted users to root."
