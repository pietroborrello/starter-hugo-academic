I am a Microarchitecture Security Researcher at Apple SEAR.

I received my PhD at the Sapienza University of Rome, working on Systems Security with a focus on applying Fuzzing and Program Analysis techniques to find and mitigate architectural and microarchitectural vulnerabilities.

In my [PhD Thesis](uploads/Thesis-Pietro-Borrello.pdf), I contributed to find and mitigate over one hundred bugs in software, operating systems, and CPUs.

I am also a passionate CTF player focusing on exploitation and reverse-engineering with [TRX](https://theromanxpl0it.github.io/) and [mhackeroni](https://mhackeroni.it/) teams.

Co-founder of the [DEFCON Group in Rome](https://defcon11396.it/).

BlackHat & OffensiveCon speaker and **Pwnie Award** recipient:
- **Best Desktop Bug** for *"Ã†PIC Leak: Architecturally Leaking Uninitialized Data from the Microarchitecture"*
- **Most Innovative Research** for *"Custom Processing Unit: Tracing and Patching Intel Atom Microcode"*
