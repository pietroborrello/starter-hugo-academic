I am a PhD Student at the Sapienza University of Rome, working on Systems Security.
My focus is applying Fuzzing and Program Analysis techniques to find and mitigate architectural and microarchitectural vulnerabilities.

I am also a passionate CTF player focusing on exploitation and reverse-engineering with [TRX](https://theromanxpl0it.github.io/) and [mhackeroni](https://mhackeroni.it/) teams.
